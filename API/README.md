# API Integration Portfolio

This is my portfolio project demonstrating **API integration**.  

I built a **Discord Bot** using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to generate a bot token and connect it to my Python code.  
The bot is able to check discounts of specific games on **Steam** by consuming the **Steam Store API**.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. The bot is created in the **Discord Developer Portal** and connected using a bot token.  
2. I wrote the bot using **Python** and the `discord.py` library.  
3. When a user types `/diskon` in the Discord server, the bot:  
   - Calls the **Steam Store API**:  
     ```
     https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=<APPID>
     ```
   - Fetches the game details (title, price, discount percentage).  
   - Returns the result back into the Discord chat.
